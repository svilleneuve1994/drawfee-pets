Drawfee is a comedy drawing YouTube show where artists (primarily Nathan Yaffe, Jacob Andrews, Julia Lepetit, and Karina Farek) turn audience suggestions into silly drawings.

Drawfee Pets is a lovingly made fan-project to give a home to these wayward drawings.

Functionally, this is a virtual pet website. I use this project as a playground for testing or implementing new things I've learned. It is built using the MERN stack.
